### Task

1. Base on [this reading](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1f45REi3k4), create an explanation about `Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages` in your README
2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?, check the sources and answer the question in your README

   - [Video Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G81hoJTvQVg)

   - [Blog Source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Why-java-is-both-compiled-and-interpreted-language)

   - [StackOverflow Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1326071/is-java-a-compiled-or-an-interpreted-programming-language)

### Solution:
<ul>
  <li>Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Code written in Java is:

<strong>First compiled</strong> to bytecode by a program called <i>javac</i> as shown in the left section of the image above;

Then, as shown in the right section of the above image, another program called java starts the Java runtime environment and it may <strong>compile and/or interpret</strong> the bytecode by using the Java Interpreter/JIT Compiler.

After reading the article and watched the video given, I agree with the explanation above, which isposted in the stackoverflow source. Java is a hybrid language, it can be interpreted or compiled.
