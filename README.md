> My name is Gerson, and I'm an Operations Team Leader. I have been a leader for more than two years and I have had fun and met great people along the way. I have always wanted to become a programmer when I was first introduced to this beautiful world. I created my first website in 2014. Due to special circumstances I could not continue learning programming. In my new year's resolution I decided that I want to go back to those glorious days of programming.

> For that reason I decided to join core code to learn Javascript, new technologies, meet new colleagues and grow as a developer. I'm a very curious and committed person, who believes that hard work pays off.
