# From JSON to REST

## Description

Now that you know a little better what an API is, it's time to learn  
about one of the most popular ways to create an API for web applications, REST APIs.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is HTTP? <p><i>ðŸ”¶HTTP is an "application layer" protocol for establishing communication between a web browser and a web server.</i></p>
2. What is JSON? <p><i>ðŸ”¶It stores and transports data. Is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.</i></p>
   - Is JSON the same as a plain Javascript object?<p><i>ðŸ”¶No, it may be similar in the syntax but there's a difference when adding quotation marks. <a href="https://twitter.com/tapasadhikary/status/1463493300225204225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1463493300225204225%7Ctwgr%5E8b0ee938d2a0b236d2daa843bc85fce6b966418a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freecodecamp.org%2Fnews%2Fwhat-is-json-a-json-file-example%2F">Source</a></i></p>
3. What is REST?<p><i>ðŸ”¶REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines the constraints to create web services. The web services that follows the REST architectural style is called RESTful Web Services. It differentiates between the computer system and web services. The REST architectural style describes the six barriers.</i></p>
   - Is REST a programming language, framework, technology, or architecture pattern?<p><i>ðŸ”¶An architectural style.</i></p>
4. What is a Resource in REST? <p><i>ðŸ”¶A resource can be defined as a vital element to be referenced within a client-server system. REST architecture treats all of its content as a resource, which includes Html Pages, Images, Text Files, Videos, etc.</i></p>
   - What is a resource identifier?<p><i>ðŸ”¶Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) used to access a RESTP API.</i></p>
5. What is an HTTP method?<p><i>ðŸ”¶It's what allows us to connect between an aplication to the web/server</i></p>
   - What HTTP methods does REST use within its architecture rules?
  <p><i>
  
  
    GET retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
    POST creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
    PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
    PATCH performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
    DELETE removes the resource at the specified URI.

  </i></p> 
   - Why do we use HTTP methods in REST and how do they relate to resources?<p><i>ðŸ”¶Because it allows us to connect or get data from the client or give information. </i></p> [Source](https://hackernoon.com/http-methods-and-why-you-should-be-using-them-on-your-api-98e26b0a7e57)
6. Is REST the same as HTTP? <p><i>ðŸ”¶No. HTTP is a contract or protocol whilst REST is an architectural style or concept.</i></p>

<!-- It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of REST, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers. -->

<!-- ## How to submit my solution?

Add your answers to your README file, add a link to the github profile
of the colleagues with whom you exchanged ideas. -->
