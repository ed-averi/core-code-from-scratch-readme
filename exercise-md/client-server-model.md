# Client-Server Model

## Description

Having a solid understanding of how the communication between a
client and server is carried out will give you greater visibility
of how the web currently works.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is a Server? <p><i>ðŸ”¶A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network.</i></p>

2. What is a Client?<p><i>ðŸ”¶A client is a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server. The server is often (but not always) located on a separate physical computer.</i></p>
3. Is a server just another physical computer?<p><i>ðŸ”¶A server can be a physical machine, a virtual machine or even a software performing server services. So the way a server functions depends on how the word server is used in a context</i></p>
   <p><i>ðŸ”¶Application Server is a term that sometimes is mixed with a web server. While a web server handles mainly HTTP protocols, the application server deals with several different protocols, including, but not limited, to HTTP.</i></p>

1. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?<p><i>ðŸ”¶Yes</i></p>
2. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?<p><i>ðŸ”¶Client-server is a relationship in which one program (the client) requests a service or resource from another program(server). So, "Yes"</i></p>
   - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web? <p><i><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/client-server-model">ðŸ”¶Peer to peer</a></i></p>

<!-- It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of the client-server model, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.
